Brent Warring Assignment 2

Implementation of banker algorithm. Reads input folder line by line, single digit number seperated by commas. First set of lines go into alloc, next set into max, and final line into avail. Used online references such as geeks for geeks for help with solution.

Biggest challenge was understanding how the banker algorithm works fully, implementation wasn't too hard after that, also had a little trouble with file reading.

compile and run using:
$ gcc banker.c -o banker
$ ./banker

Included files:
#include <stdio.h>

Project completed through vscode connecting to wasp through ssh so I saved files locally off that to my mac then uploaded to github.
